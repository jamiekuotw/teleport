# Session & Identity Locking

Teleport provides a locking mechanism to restrict access to a computing
environment on an _ad hoc_ basis, e.g. to disable a compromised user or prevent
access during cluster maintenance.

When a lock is in force, all interactions (like SSH/DB/k8s
connections or certificate requests) matched by the lock's target are rejected.
A lock can target the following objects or attributes:
* a Teleport user by the user's name;
* a Teleport [RBAC](../reference.mdx) role by the role's name;
* an MFA device by the device's UUID;
* an OS/UNIX login;
* a Teleport node by the node's UUID (effectively unregistering it and blocking
  it from the cluster).

<Admonition type="warning">
  Locking support was introduced in Teleport v7.1. To fully enforce the locks
  at all components, you should update **all** `teleport` binaries in your
  deployment.

## Creating a new lock

Locks are modelled as [resources](../../admin-guide.mdx#resources) with `kind:
lock`.  To easily create a new lock, one can run the `tctl lock` command:

```
$ tctl lock --user=foo@example.com --message="Suspicious activity." --ttl=10h
Created a lock with name "dc7cee9d-fe5e-4534-a90d-db770f0234a1".
```

Note that without specifying `--ttl` or `--expires` the created lock remains in
force until explicitly removed with `tctl rm`.  Refer to `tctl lock --help` for
the list of all supported parameters.

Under the hood, `tctl lock` creates a resource similar to the following:

```yaml
kind: lock
version: v2
metadata:
  name: dc7cee9d-fe5e-4534-a90d-db770f0234a1
spec:
  target:
    user: foo@example.com
  message: "Suspicious activity."
  expires: "2021-08-14T22:27:00Z"  # RFC3339 format
```

The `kind: lock` resources can also be created and updated using `tctl create`
as per usual, see the [Admin Guide](../../admin-guide.mdx#resources) for more
details.

## Lock in force

With a lock in force, all established connections involving the lock's target
get terminated while any new requests are rejected.

Errors returned and warnings logged in this situation feature a message of the
form:
```
lock targeting User:"foo@example.com" is in force: Suspicious activity.
```

## Locking mode

If a Teleport component cannot properly synchronize its local lock view with
the backend, there is a decision to be made about whether to rely on the last
known locks. This decision strategy is encoded as one of the two modes:

* `strict` mode causes all interactions to be terminated when the locks are not
  guaranteed to be up to date;
* `best_effort` mode keeps relying on the most recent locks.

The cluster-wide mode defaults to `best_effort` and can be set in
`teleport.yaml` of the Auth server:

```yaml
auth_service:
    authentication:
        locking_mode: best_effort
```

It is also possible to configure the locking mode for a particular role:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v4
metadata:
    name: example-role-with-strict-locking
spec:
    options:
       lock: strict
```

When none of the roles involved in an interaction specify the mode or when
there is no user involved, the mode is taken from the cluster-wide setting.

With multiple potentially conflicting locking modes (the cluster-wide default
and the individual per-role settings) a single occurrence of `strict` suffices
for the local lock view to become evaluated strictly.

## Resources

A Teleport administrator has two tools to configure a Teleport cluster:

- The [configuration file](./config.mdx) is used for static configuration like
  the cluster name.
- The [`tctl`](./cli.mdx#tctl) admin tool is used for manipulating dynamic
  records like Teleport users.

[`tctl`](./cli.mdx#tctl) has convenient subcommands for dynamic
configuration, like `tctl users` or `tctl nodes`. However, for dealing with
more advanced topics, like connecting clusters together or troubleshooting
trust, [`tctl`](./cli.mdx#tctl) offers the more powerful, although
lower-level CLI interface called `resources`.

The concept is borrowed from the REST programming pattern. A cluster is composed
of different objects (aka, resources) and there are just three common operations
that can be performed on them: `get` , `create` , `remove` .

A resource is defined as a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file.
Every resource in Teleport has three required fields:

- `Kind` - The type of resource
- `Name` - A required field in the `metadata` to uniquely identify the resource
- `Version` - The version of the resource format

Everything else is resource-specific and any component of a Teleport cluster can
be manipulated with just three CLI commands:

| Command | Description | Examples |
| - | - | - |
| [`tctl get`](./cli.mdx#tctl-get) | Get one or multiple resources | `tctl get users` or `tctl get user/joe` |
| [`tctl rm`](./cli.mdx#tctl-rm) | Delete a resource by type/name | `tctl rm user/joe` |
| [`tctl create`](./cli.mdx#tctl-create) | Create a new resource from a YAML file. Use `-f` to override / update | `tctl create -f joe.yaml` |

  By default Teleport uses [YAML format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) to describe resources.
  YAML is a human-readable alternative to JSON or XML, but it's sensitive to white space.
  Pay attention to spaces vs tabs.
</Admonition>

Here's an example how the YAML resource definition for a user Joe might look
like. It can be retrieved by executing [`tctl get user/joe`](./cli.mdx#tctl-get)

```yaml
kind: user
version: v2
metadata:
  name: joe
spec:
  roles: admin
  status:
    # Users can be temporarily locked in a Teleport system, but this
    # functionality is reserved for internal use for now.
    is_locked: false
    lock_expires: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
    locked_time: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
  traits:
    # These are "allowed logins" which are usually specified as the
    # last argument to `tctl users add`
    logins:
    - joe
    - root
  # Any resource in Teleport can automatically expire.
  expires: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
  # for internal use only
  created_by:
    time: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
    user:
      name: builtin-Admin
```

  Some of the fields you will see when printing resources are used only internally and are not meant to be changed. Others are reserved for future use.
</Admonition>

Here's the list of resources currently exposed via [`tctl`](./cli.mdx#tctl):

| Resource Kind | Description |
| - | - |
| user | A user record in the internal Teleport user DB. |
| node | A registered SSH node. The same record is displayed via `tctl nodes ls` |
| cluster | A trusted cluster. See [here](../../admin-guide.mdx#trusted-clusters) for more details on connecting clusters together. |
| role | A role assumed by users. The Teleport Open Source Edition only includes one role: "admin", but Enterprise teleport users can define their own roles. |
| connector | Authentication connectors for [Single Sign-On](../../enterprise/sso.mdx) (SSO) for SAML, OIDC and Github. |

**Examples:**

```bash
# List all connectors:
tctl get connectors

# Dump a SAML connector called "okta":
tctl get saml/okta

# Delete a SAML connector called "okta":
tctl rm saml/okta

# Delete an OIDC connector called "gworkspace":
tctl rm oidc/gworkspace

# Delete a github connector called "myteam":
tctl rm github/myteam

# Delete a local user called "admin":
tctl rm users/admin
```

<Admonition type="note">
  Although `tctl get connectors` will show you every connector, when working with an individual connector you must use the correct `kind`, such as `saml` or `oidc`. You can see each connector's `kind` at the top of its YAML output from `tctl get connectors`.
